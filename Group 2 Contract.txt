Ground Rules:
1. - Communicate regularly, don’t leave people on read
2. - Monday (AM), Wednesday (AM), Friday, possibly weekend planning to meet 
3. - Communicate ahead of time (start of the week explain your availability)
4. - Maybe meet in person if necessary
5. - Providing eachother with constructive feedback


Things We Don’t Want To Experience:
1. - Uneven contribution 
2. - Ghosting/No Communication
3. - A bad grade… aim for the A


I function best in groups when… everyone does their contribution and communicates with one another. 


I really hope our group can…communicate regularly and succeed.
